Data Analysis and Visualization on Customer Churn Trends and Retention Factors. The interactive dashboard can be found at (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.valdez/viz/CustomerChurnAnalysis_17390989836820/Dashboard1)

## Overview
In this analysis, I explore key factors influencing customer churn in the banking industry. The goal of this project is to identify patterns and trends that contribute to churn, providing actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. Key areas analyzed include tenure impact, product ownership, geographic trends, credit scores, and demographic influences on churn rates.

## Data Source
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset/data), contains detailed records of bank customers, including:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, country)
- Banking behavior (credit score, account balance, number of products)
- Customer status (active membership, churn label)
- Other financial indicators (tenure, estimated salary, credit card ownership)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Used Google Sheets (Microsoft Excel) to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data for accurate analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted pivot table analysis in Excel to calculate churn rates across various customer attributes.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize churn trends, identify high-risk customer segments, and uncover retention opportunities.

## Key Insights
- **Germany had the highest churn rate (32%)**, suggesting potential regional differences in customer retention strategies.
- **Customers with 0-1 years of tenure had the highest churn rate (22.58%)**, indicating early-stage disengagement.
- **The 50-60 age group had the highest churn (56%)**, highlighting a need for age-specific retention strategies.
- **Customers with 3 products or more had an 91% churn rate**,suggesting a possible issue with over-selling or product satisfaction.
- **Customers labeled as 'active' still had a 22% churn rate,** raising questions about the definition and effectiveness of active engagement.
